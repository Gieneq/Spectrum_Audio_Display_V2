## TODO list
- [x] implementing FFT, display driver and animation controller on STM32F4,
- [x] designing custom PCB for preamplifier and digital circuitry, featuring:
  + TDA2822 preamplifier for FFT feed,
  + TDA2822 preamplifier for driving builtin speakers,
  + gain control using digital potentiometer,
  + VU meter,
  + ESP324C for WiFi capabilities,
  + test signal generation using AD9833,
  + bluetooth connectivity,
  + selectable signal source.
- [] test custom PCB and adapt STM32's surce code to use new features,
- [] create wiki page about preparing custom visual effects,

## STM32 HAL CubeMX sourcecode ‚öôÔ∏è 
In this [directory](ASD_STM32F4) there is source code for main microcontroller. It uses builtin SAR ADC for sampling in DMA circular mode feedeing FFT buffer. SPI is used to controll 399+14 WS2812B LEDs with encoded MOSI signal. Check details on wiki page (comming soon).

## FFT evaluation and research üî•
In this [directory](FFT_Notebook) there is shown comparison between CMSIS DSP library and Python scipy.
